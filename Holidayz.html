            The pulsating beats of electronic music filled the air as colorful
            laser lights danced across the crowd, creating an electrifying
            atmosphere. Revelers, dressed in glitter and neon, cheered and
            counted down to midnight, celebrating the start of a new year with

            Labor Day was created to honor the contributions and achievements of
            American workers, emerging from the labor movement in the late 19th
            century. It became a federal holiday in 1894, following widespread
            strikes and advocacy for better working conditions, fair wages, and
            reasonable hours.
